# Contacts App

Configuration based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)


## Scripts

Install dependencies using yarn or npm manager:

```sh
yarn install
```

Start development version:

```sh
yarn start
```

For building a production version use:

```sh
yarn build
```

> Note: Python server backend should be running on port: 127.0.0.1:5000. For filtering to work properly
fix runserver.py line:45 by adding `if contact[k] is not None and v in contact[k]`. A server with a fixed bug can be downloaded from [there](https://github.com/rlengvenis/contacts-app-server-0.2.7)

## Notes

### Folder structure ###

* `actions` - actions and their tests
* `components` - organized by page and tests
* `config` - cofiguration files
* `reducers` - reducers and their tests
* `styles` - generic css styles

### Unit tests ###

`src/setupTests.js` holds project test env configuration. Technologies used:

* [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) - a wrapper for React test utils
* [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) - assertion library
* [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) - a test framework
* [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) - a javascript DOM implementation
