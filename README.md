# Create React App Redux

An opinionated initial React Redux configuration based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)


## Scripts

Install dependencies using yarn or npm manager:

```sh
yarn install
```

Start development version:

```sh
yarn start
```

For building a production version use:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Design notes

### Folder structure ###

Due to a specific domain, reducers and actions are reused on different pages, therefore they are put to `src/reducers` and `src/actions` folder appropriately. In general domain/feature/page oriented component file structure is used:

* `actions` - actions and their tests
* `components` - organized by page and tests
* `config` - cofiguration files
* `reducers` - reducers and their tests
* `selectors` - selectors used to select domain objects from normalized data
* `styles` - css styles written using BEM and SCSS

### CSS design ###

BEM methodology was used for writting CSS styles. CSS styles are located under `src/styles` folder. General structure is:

* `core` - css variables and reset
* `layouts` - reusable container layouts
* `modules` - reusable modules
* `pages` - page dependant styling

Plain BEM was used due to the fact that BEM methodology itself solves global namespacing and other issues. Styled-components is an option I will consider using in future app versions.

### Unit tests ###

`src/setupTests.js` holds project test env configuration. Technologies used:

* [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) - a wrapper for React test utils
* [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) - assertion library
* [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) - a test framework
* [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) - a javascript DOM implementation 

>Note: I have used `Mocha` instead of create-react-app native `Jest` due to `Jest` issues while using `jsdom` and rendering canvas related elements to DOM.
